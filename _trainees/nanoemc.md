I work on developing applications for Fermilab's Elastic Analysis
Facility (EAF) with Burt Holtzman and Maria Acosta Flechas. Analysis
facilities are spaces for researchers to write and run analysis
code without needing to configure their personal computers which
helps with portability and performance. As such, another part of
my project is ensuring that physicists and other users have their
needs met and that the EAF runs smoothly on for the user. I also
help develop user-friendly documentation.
